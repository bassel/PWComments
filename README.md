💬 Utterances repository for the comments on my personal website 

## Why Utterances?
For the exact reasons stated by them:
- [Open source](https://github.com/utterance). 🙌
- No tracking, no ads, always free. 📡🚫
- No lock-in. All data stored in GitHub issues. 🔓
- Styled with [Primer](http://primer.style/), the css toolkit that powers GitHub. 💅
- Dark theme. 🌘
- Lightweight. Vanilla TypeScript. No font downloads, JavaScript frameworks or polyfills for evergreen browsers. 🐦🌲

Unlike [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), Utterances is more privacy-focused and more lightweight, which aligns well with my website's philosophy.  

If you're interested, maybe you can [give it a shot](https://utteranc.es/) too!
